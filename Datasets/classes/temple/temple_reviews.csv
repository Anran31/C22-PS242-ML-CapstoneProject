"This is a very spiritual place. You should take a local guide that will explain you what to do exactly in order to get the right experience from this place. They are volunteering but you give them donation at the end, as much as you want. My guide explain me the procedure of what to do and gave me the offerings you should give at the beginning. For me it was one of the spiritual experience I have ever had because I knew exactly what to do.",Ron Fiarman
This was by far my favorite Hindu Temple that I've been too. Very nice place I did not do the cleaning pool thing. This is just my view but unless you practice the Hindu Religion their is no point to it. Your just in the way of the people who do practice that Religion. 05/08/2022,William C Brown
Ancient Holy Water Temple in Tampaksiring. Well organised tourist attraction. Best if you can find Balinese priest or family to bring you there. You will understand so much more of the whole meaning of this sacred place that way.,Ari Wekku S√§√§ski
"Visited this temple during the Hari Raya season and so, it was very crowded. Many visitors queued to bathe/""baptized"" in the holy water. There are 2 water spots that need to be skipped but quite a number of tourists didn't know about it. Do your research before joining.",Andri Wirawan
Temple history dated 10th Century and since the date spring water exists there over 1000 years thats why this spring and the water accepted holy water by Balinese Hindus that they wash under the water for purification and blessing by doing the washing rutiel. Very famous and very crowded. If you want to do this rutiel you have to wear pool sarong and wait for long line. Better come earlier. Tip: use sunscreen or wear a t-shirt if you wait for the rituel.,yunus emre demir

"Entry is 50k. Parking scooter 2k. Nice place and currently not crowded at all. Please only do purification if you really believe in it and not because of any nice picture or Instagram fame!!!!! It is still a holy place. There are lots of souvenir shops at the exit. They simple want to sell, so just negotiate friendly and with a smile. If you don‚Äôt want to buy something, just ignore them and walk through. I‚Äôm was surprised by the number of shops but maybe there are usually more tourists. At the exit you also find fresh fruit juice at 15k which was yummy.",Daniela Wieser
"This temple was called the Holy Water. In the middle of a beautiful forest there were many temples with unique architecture. There was a large pool where pilgrims went to the holy water and washed themselves. To enter the Bali temples, you must wear long clothes, otherwise there are fabrics that are given to you to wear around your waist. The trees here had giant tropical fruits. At the end of the temple was a spring that came out of the ground of holy water. There was good energy in the space and we could feel calm.üôèüèªüå±üå±üå±üôèüèª",Shahrzad sh

"As usual, our tour guide dropped us at the entrance.  There‚Äôs a pathway that leads to the Royal Temple‚Äôs entrance from the adjacent street. A less touristy but more peaceful of the famous Balinese temples. The temple is nestled between wonderful greenery. At the back of the garden are wonderful pristine gardens where you can spend some moments in solitude. Visitors can see pryers and rituals inside the temple from the peripheral wall. Only locals clad in traditional attires and offerings for the god are allowed inside the temple.You can see water on your left & right while walking down the modern day bridge.We saw a huge hall to the right of the entrance. According to our tour guide, it was used for communal gatherings & later cockfighting activities. To the left of the entrance was a water.As we walked further, we saw traditional Bali architecture with multi-tiered thatched roof shrines. The shrines were all in a large compound & surrounded by a narrow water canal or pond.Furthermore, each shrine was taller than the previous. Moreover, the Royal Temple‚Äôs garden landscape included ponds filled with lotuses. Both gardens & ponds surrounding the Royal Temple provide a calming atmosphere.Taman Ayun Temple is less busy than others. The architecture & the foresight of the Royals certainly helped in making the temple into one of the most beautiful in Bali. Overall recommend üëå",Faria Tabassum

"A large and beautiful temple in Mengwi. A very good cultural tourism for my family.  Has been much improved and equipped since our visit in 2013.  Very well manicured lawn and garden.  Very clean toilets, actually cleaner than toilet in tourist place toilets I visited in USA and Europe. Caveat that the low visitor count might be the reason why the toilet is so clean.  There‚Äôs a small museum telling the story of the Mengwi empire and Taman Ayun temple. There‚Äôs also a sizeable auditorium with a looping video on the above subjects.",Sendy Filemon

I reviewed this alongside the Tanah Lot Temple because they are in such close proximity to one another. This temple is still under construction with nothing much to see. More can be seen from the walkway separating the two temples. When done with construction it‚Äôll be a great place to hang out and feel the ocean breeze.,Roamer1
Pura Baru Bolong temple is on the same way as Tanah lot. It is situated in the same place but is in the opposite direction of one another. Tanah lot is to North side while Pura Batu is in South side. From both these ends you can see sunset with your naked eye. The temple is not for visitors to take pictures it is only opened for devotees but still if you want to take a picture you can but from a distance. The place is located near the top edge and has some quite distant good views from there. Inside the temple you can see place to sit and the temple has a good view which soothes your mind. The surrounding area has some local food bites also has some shopping places. If you walk little far there are shacks where you can enjoy the view and relax for few hours in the sun. This place is good to visit for sunset. On the very same day you can visit tanah lot as well as Pura Batu Bolong temple. After 7pm you can actually visit the temple as there are no ropes surrounded to the temple. Enjoy the sound waves. The temple has history and you can read it on the stone carved there. Place is usually crowded and people are seeing taking photos and selfies. You can relax yourself in the shadow. Also you can take staircase to the beach down it very breezy and peaceful. On the right side. You can see the blue water and sit and relax their.,May D'velra

"Beautiful coastline of multiple temples. Before you get to the pathway along the ocean where the temples are located, you can have your taxi or Grab driver drop you off outside the gate. If the driver drops you off inside, you‚Äôll have to pay the car entry fee. Before walking towards the coastline, you‚Äôll walk through a shopping area where there are bathrooms, restaurants, caf√©s, and local craft merchants. I‚Äôve been told most people go and watch the sunset here. We went in the middle of the day and the view of the coastline is breathtaking as well as viewing the ancient temples. If my memory is correct, you can only enter one of the temples if you have appropriate clothing. It was difficult to confirm a Grab driver for a pick-up so I highly recommend if you can‚Äôt find one, the taxi stand in the main parking lot has set pricing based on the district you‚Äôre traveling to.",Aaron Miller

"I visited Tanah Lot in Feb 2020 during my Bali Trip. We resided in Kuta and from here we took a bike and reached Tanah Lot. We saw other alternatives as well but due to the heavy traffic of Bali, it's better to use Bike instead of Taxi or Grab/Uber/GoJek. We used Google Map and reached to the place in 45-50 mins but it was an awesome experience. We enjoyed a lot during the journey as we stucked at many places due to traffic but its was a good decision to use the Bike for this Journey.  Tanah Lot is a rock formation off the Indonesian island of Bali. It is home to the ancient Hindu pilgrimage temple Pura Tanah Lot, a popular tourist and cultural icon for photography. The temple is one of seven sea temples around the Balinese coast.  Our bad luck is that we didn't get a chance to get into the temple because of last night heavy rain and high tides.

"The temple is believed to built around AD 1020. The temple is easily accessible from all parts of Bali. The temple is built around the ""Trimurti"" concept of Hindu mythology. The main deity in this temple is Vishnu. Once you enter the temple, you feel as if you are thrown back in time. The sculptures, the ambience and the mere atmosphere is enough for you to walk through a time which is three hundred years back. Everything is built using Red bricks, lava stones and wood and the roofing is done with bamboo leaves. The temple has been destroyed many times by earth quakes and every time they renovated it with a perfection which is the most wonderful quality of Balinese architecture. You have to get the ""Sarong"" from the Temple auditorium which is opposite to the temple entrance. You have to give some donation to the temple, but is not mandatory. It is good you give some donation, as it forms the spine of keeping these temple still intact.",THE LONE TRAVELER
