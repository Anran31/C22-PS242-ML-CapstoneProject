"This view is taken at 5 to 6 pm in the noon. The weather is good with a little bit cloudy. However, the sunset still showed itself in a very good scenary. What a lovely sunset and waves you can see and enjoy at Kuta beach, Bali. Many people, from couples, grup of friends, and a big family, spend their leisure time sitting in the seashore of this beach.  To enter this beach, you only need pay for the parking service, 2 thousand rupiah for motorcycle. Then, you can enjoy swimming or drinking coconut water here. The fruit is big, delicious and still young. The price is 35 thousand rupiah, quite commensurate with the large of the fruit wkwk.  Although the sunset is already gone, people are still sitting there to simply talk together or enjoying massage services. For your information, many women there offered this services to the visitors, it can be men or women. The massage is priced from 10-35 thousand rupiah, it‚Äôs depen on their work hour. Somehow, they almost like forcing you to do the massage, just say sorry or thanks to them politely it you are not interested in massaging there.  Not only enjoying the view of the waves, but also you can visit many cafe, restaurants and also mall near to the beach. There are also some wagons that are ready to bring you down the street. Moreover, you can see many souvenirs shops accross the beach. They offered many discount to all items. Feel free to negotiate‚úåüèª",Ghea Azzahra

If you come over here, you may help the domestic commerce by buying the coconut water or the cold drink. There's another option to enjoy your holiday here, such as trying a new experience by surfing. You can't? You could be glad because there are so many surfing trainer here.",Nat Furgeva

Balian‚Äôs beautiful velvety-black volcanic sand beach stretches north around 600 metres from the mouth of the Balian River to the rocky headland. Although the waves are not the best for swimmers due to strong rips and hidden rocks, the beach offers multiple surf breaks: a left and two main rights, one of which runs for a couple of hundred metres on a good day, and while the waves out the back are for more able surfers, in close plenty of broken waves tumble.",Rakibul islam

"Uluwatu Beach, early January 2022. A long scooter ride from Canggu but totally worth it.  Bring cash in bills of various denominations as there aren't ATM's.  About 75% of the businesses are closed, but the remaining ones are glad to have you and nature is always here. Good luck getting down to the beach without a guide (hence the small change) because the pathways are a totally byzantine labyrinth. I stopped at a scenic bar half-way down and called it a day. Cheap but very cold beer,  and the occasional mobile hawker who wants you to buy a few bracelets (but hey, they've had a hard pandemic, have a heart, but a couple for gifts later... the 30k you spend means dinner for their whole family). Worth it just for the photos.",Tom Richmond

Beautiful and serene place. Loved it.,debojyoti banerjee
"Finally find it, after exploring some spots through the downstairs I got some good spots here. Lovely angle at sunset time. The owner of resto said that in the night there‚Äôs big waves and sometimes storm that could bring water to the highest place of the cliff so they were afraid to stay there in the night. What a magnificent place instead. Lovely but frightening at night. Totally a coun with double exposuresüôèüèª‚ò∫Ô∏è But I love it.",Matthew One
cool spot! unique experience!  good spot for surfing!  Lovely place with an epic view and a lot of things to do!

Great spot for a dinner or drink with the surfing peeps everywhere far in the ocean!  take  your time and enjoy your day!  cheers!,Jay Jay

"I had the joy of visiting Uluwatu Beach on one of my trips to Bali.  About a ten minute walk down stairs that lead to a nice little community.  They have beautiful cliff side restaurants, little shopping stores and surf shops.  By far, one of the most beautiful beaches and scenic viewing places I have ever been.  On Bali, it‚Äôs a little out of the way to get to but perfection!",Rene Trevino
"Lovely setting to grab sunset photos. It is more suited to surfers, though not a great deal of sand on the beach therefore quite rocky  Prices of food and drink are a lot cheaper than Kuta, so enjoy an evening in one of the many restaurants. I ate at District 6 and the pizza was excellent as was the tuna burger, definitely recommended. The atmosphere was great too.",Carl Harris

Beautiful beach,Ikhsan Rahandono
Good set up. plenty of places to eat though most are expensive. Don't be tempted to surf the reef on the low tide like I did. Looks fun but the cuts are not worth it. The full tide wave is probably better suited to learners. More experienced surfers are better of surfing the ones you can see in the distance,Matt Dabron
